            <p className="sagraph">Benefits of Having Self-Respect
            These are some of the benefits of having a healthy sense of 
            self-respect, according to Dr. Zackson:Internal
             sense of happiness: People who respect 
            themselves understand that they must first look 
            inward to discover their worth, esteem, and happiness.
             As a result, their life is more stable and fulfilling 
             than those who compare themselves to others or those who 
             rely on external sources of validation.Commitment to
              upholding personal values: People 
            with self-respect have a set of morals and values by
             which they evaluate their character and actions.2 They 
             are often willing to bet all they have on upholding these 
             norms of behavior, as their very worth and sense 
             of self depend on it.Ability to establish boundaries: Self-respect re
            quires people to have the fortitude to establish limits 
            and fight for them when they are threatened. Respecting 
            oneself enough to stand up for one’s beliefs and boundaries 
            also helps command the respect of others.Strong sense of dignity: Respecting oneself mean
            s having a strong sense of dignity toward one’s person 
            and position, and honoring it at all times.3

             Having an inner peace plan—and working on it every day—is a good way to ensure you reach your goal.
              Two goals to work towards include conserving your emotional energy and reducing stress.
              Giving yourself a mental health day, being mindful of your quality of life, and being 
              still are a few ways to improve your inner peace.
              Has modern technology and your ability to access infinite amounts of information and 
              entertainment brought less stress or more stress into your life?
              Sure, we can buy everything we want online—clothes, computers, and cars—and yes, 
              it’s convenient. But has it made our lives more peaceful?Emotional energy
              Most of us would agree that emotional energy has become a precious commodity in our
               lives. When we feel emotionally depleted, then anxiety and stress are the natural 
               by-products. Left unchecked, stress can lead to feelings of being out of control.
              As a result, stress can prompt us to seek temporary relief in unhealthy habits that 
              create more stress in the long run. Turning to alcohol, comfort food, or overspending 
              might provide temporary relief and distraction, but these things greatly complicate our lives.
              Controlling your stress
              Not everything that causes us stress can be eliminated—nor should it. Low-level stress
               stimulates 
              the brain to boost productivity and concentration. It can also be a big motivator to make changes, solve problems, or accomplish goals.
              In addition, many sources of stress are simply beyond our control. It’s become so commonplace for people 
              to feel stressed and overloaded that we tend to forget there is an alternative way to live.
